# PowerShell
PowerShell Week 9-12
## Assignment Scope
This assignment was to copy the PowerShell exercise folders from week 9-12 to a GitHub repository (repo). A GitHub public repo was setup and included a readme file to explain about this repo. A branch was also created called Bugfix. Code was changed in the exercise folders and saved to the local repo. This was then committed to the *branch repo*. Then these changes where commit to *main repo* and then git push was used to update GitHub.     
## The aims of this assignment 
1. Create a repo in GitHub called PowerShell.
2. Include a Readme file explaining about the repo.
3. Add gitignore for to exclude unwanted bit code and not to include SSH keys.
4. Select a creative license, so the work is mark as ours.
5. Create a branch in this repo call *Bugfix*.
6. Alter some code in the exercise folders and commit it to *bugfix* branch*.
7. Commit all changes to *main* and to *GitHub* repo*. 
## Method  #
For the second part of the assignment a backup was taken of the PowerShell exercise folders. On GitHub a repo called PowerShell is created. Gitignore was selected to ignore Python files and ignore SSH. A license was selected with the setting *Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal*. A readme file is selected to be created in the repo to be used later. On the local machine a folder was created, and a clone is made using the URL from GitHub. The PowerShell exercise folders are copied to the PowerShell repo folder. Git commit is executed. After confirming Git origin is the remote GitHub URL, Git push is run from PowerShell. The files are now replicated in GitHub. Visual Studio Code (VSC) is used to edit the readme file on the local repo. It is saved to the local repo and a git status is run. This shows the file as *modified*. *Git add* updates the file. To create a branch, *Git branch* is run to create a branch called *Bugfix*.  Git log now shows head -> bugfix. In folder walkthrough 2 file Tuesday.ps1 is altered and a new file created called monday.ps1. Git add, adds this to branch Bugfix. Git checkout main is run to commit to main repo. A pull request is run in GitHub to sync *Bugfix* to *Main*. This completes successfully and the new file Monday.ps1 is present.  
There were three main tools used. Git in PowerShell, GitHub, and GitHub desktop. These tools complement each other. GitHub desktop ties all these tools together, enable a user to publish a repo locally and on GitHub. This allows the user to complete all the tasks.
