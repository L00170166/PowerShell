# PowerShell
PowerShell Week 9-12
## Assigment Scope
This assignment is to copy PowerShell exerises from week 9-12 from a local Git repositry (repo) to a GitHub repo. A GitHub public repo was setup to include a readme file to explain about the repo. A branch was also setup called PowerShell-Bugfix and with best practise. Code was copied changed in the *branch repo* and the changes commit to main *repo*.    
## The aims of this assignment 
1. Create a repo in GithHub called PowerShell.
2. Include a Readme file explaining about the repo.
3. Add gitignore for  to exclude unwanted bit code and not to include ssh keys.
4. Select a creative license, so the work is mark as ours.
5. Create a branch in this repo call PowerShell-Bugfix.
6. Alter some code in the *branch* and commit to *main*.  
6. Create a local repo for the PowerShell folder.

## Method  #
For the second part of the assignment a backup was taken of the PowerShell exercise folders. On GitHub a repo called PowerShell is created. Gitignore was selected to ignore Python files and ignore SSh. A license was selected with the setting *Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal*. A readme file is selected to be created in the repo to be used later. On the local machine a folder was created and a clone is made using the URL from Github. The PowerShell execise folders are copied the PowerShell repo folder. Git commit is executed. After confirming Git orgion is the remote GitHub URL Git push is run from shell. The files are now replicated in GitHub. Visual Studion Code (VSC) is used to edit the readme file on the local repo. It is saved to the local repo and a git status is run. This show the file as *modified*. *Git add* updates the file.
