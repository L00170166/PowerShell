# PowerShell
PowerShell Week 9-12
## Assigment Scope
This assignment is to copy PowerShell exerises from week 9-12 from a local Git repositry (repo) to a GitHub repo. A GitHub public repo was setup to include a readme file to explain about the repo. A branch was also setup called PowerShell-Bugfix and with best practise. Code was copied changed in the *branch repo* and the changes commit to main *repo*.    
## The aims of this assignment 
1. Create a repo in GithHub called PowerShell.
2. Include a Readme file explaining about the repo.
3. Add gitignore for  to exclude unwanted bit code and not to include ssh keys.
4. Select a creative license, so the work is mark as ours.
5. Create a branch in this repo call PowerShell-Bugfix.
6. Alter some code in the *branch* and commit to *main*.  
6. Create a local repo for the PowerShell folder.

## Method  #
For the second part of the assignment a backup was taken of the Python exercises folder and saved to the local desktop. Using PowerShell and running *Git init* a local Git repositry (Repo) was created in the main Python execise folder. In GitHub a repo called Python is created.  Git ignore was selected to ignore Python files and ignore SSh as in the instructure notes. A license was selected with the setting *Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal*. A readme file is selected to be created in the repo to be used later. GitHub desktop is download to the local machine. From repo in GitHub the URL is copied form the code menu and on GitHub desktop clone is select using the URL. Using Visual Studion Code (VSC) the readme is open from the repo and edited. From GitHub desktop a branch was created call *Python-Dev*. Changes where made to the Readme file using VCS. In GitHub desk and and using Git Shell we can see changes are waiting to be commit These where committed to *Python Main*, but not dev. This was pushed to GitHub. The changes could be seen in repo *main* and but not in *Dev*. GitHub desktop works well with both local Get and GithHub. It is easy to make or commit changes from Dev to Main overwriting your work. But it is easy also to revert the changes back.
